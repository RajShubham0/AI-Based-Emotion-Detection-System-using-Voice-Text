## 🔄 How the System Works

1. User provides input in the form of:
   - Text message  
   - Voice recording  

2. The system processes the input:
   - Text input is analyzed using NLP sentiment analysis
   - Voice input is analyzed using audio feature extraction

3. AI logic evaluates the processed data

4. The detected emotion is displayed on the screen
