🧠 AI Voice & Text Emotion Detection System

This project is an AI-based Emotion Detection System that analyzes human emotions from both text and voice inputs.
Users can either type a sentence or upload a voice recording, and the system predicts the emotional state behind the input using Artificial Intelligence techniques.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Understand how AI can interpret human emotions

Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis

Apply audio feature extraction for voice emotion detection

Build a simple and interactive AI application for real-life use cases

🚀 Key Features

✍️ Text Emotion Detection
Detects emotion from user-entered text.

🎤 Voice Emotion Detection
Analyzes voice recordings and predicts emotion.

🧠 AI-based Analysis
Uses sentiment analysis and audio feature extraction.

🌐 Web-based Interface
Simple, clean, and easy-to-use UI.

😃 Supported Emotions

Happy 😊

Sad 😔

Angry 😡

Neutral 😐

(Emotions may vary based on input patterns.)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit – for web interface

TextBlob – for text sentiment analysis

Librosa – for audio processing

NumPy – for numerical operations

🔄 How the Project Works

User provides text input or voice input

Input is processed using AI techniques:

Text → NLP sentiment analysis

Voice → Audio feature extraction

AI model analyzes the input

Detected emotion is displayed on the screen

📌 Use Cases

Mental health awareness (non-medical)

Emotion-aware chat applications

Learning project for AI & ML students

Human-computer interaction research
